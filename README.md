# cesm2_extvar
CESM2 (Community Earth System Model version 2)
Extract specific variables from output data generated by the CESM2 (Community Earth System Model version 2) for various components (atmosphere, ocean, land, ice, runoff) and different output frequencies (monthly, daily, etc.).
The code is meant for use in a CESM2 data processing pipeline, where researchers need to extract specific variables for further analysis.
The choice of variables, components, and output frequencies can be customized based on the research objectives.
It also handles multiple ensemble members.

Here's an overview of what the script does:

It begins with some user-defined input parameters at the top of the script, including experiment and case names, ensemble member IDs, directories for input and output data, output frequencies, and the analysis period.
The script defines two dictionaries: extra_vars and basic_vars. These dictionaries specify which variables to extract for each component and output frequency. The extra_vars dictionary appears to be designed for additional (extra) variables, while basic_vars contains basic variables for extraction.
The extvar function is defined, which takes an ensemble member ID and a list of components as arguments. This function performs the extraction of variables for the specified ensemble member and components.
Inside the extvar function, the script constructs input and output file names based on the provided parameters, and it determines which variables to extract based on the extra_vars or basic_vars dictionary.
The script then uses the ncks and ncrcat commands to extract and concatenate the data files for the specified variables, time periods, and components. The extracted data is saved in output files with a specific naming convention.
The script creates a list of tasks for parallel processing, where each task corresponds to a specific ensemble member and component combination.
It starts and joins these tasks for parallel execution, allowing for faster data extraction.
Finally, there's an "end of program" comment to signify the end of the script.
